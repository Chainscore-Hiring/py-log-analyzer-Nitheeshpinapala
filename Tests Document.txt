The Distributed Log Analyzer system requires thorough testing to ensure its functionality, performance, and fault tolerance. 
Functional testing includes verifying the correct parsing of log files, extracting metrics like response times and error rates, and ensuring proper work distribution among workers. 
Additionally, real-time metric calculation must be tested to ensure accurate and continuous updates. 
Failure handling is critical, with tests designed to simulate worker and coordinator failures and verify that work is reassigned and the system recovers without disruptions.
Performance testing evaluates the systemâ€™s ability to process large log files efficiently, measuring the impact of increasing file sizes and worker counts on processing time and memory usage. 
Edge cases like empty log files and malformed entries must also be handled gracefully, ensuring the system doesn't crash and provides appropriate error handling. 
These test cases ensure that the system is both scalable and resilient, capable of handling diverse operational scenarios while maintaining high performance.
